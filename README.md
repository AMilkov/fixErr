# fixErr - Let's fix the errors in the code, shell we?

Did you ever tought what will happen when we humans are able to build the first general AI.  
What will be the first thing that the newly born "mind" will do?  
Well I think that the first thing that the general AI will do is to try to fix the errors in his own code.  
Sounds logical, right?
